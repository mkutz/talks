Abstract
--------

In this talk I will show a way of assuring quality in agile projects. I will describe how team members may interact and work together to assure the best quality for a product. This includes some ideas about test automation and semantic testing and which tools may be used for Java projects.

Description
-----------

Agile Development Processes (especially Scrum) are getting more and more widely used these days but by adopting these practices we leave the well known paths of traditional software development waterfalls.

One area most CEO's get at least a little scared about in this area is QA. This talk will introduce some good QA practices for cross functional teams.

I will describe which communication relationships within a cross functional team are most important in terms of assuring quality and how they may be established. This will also show that test automation is not a should bit rather a must in agile development.

Further I will show a quite generic hierarchy of (automated) test types that should be present and describe how the team might create and maintain them.

After stating which tests should be present, I will show a way how to write them in an understandable and maintainable semantic way. And show how this helps to ensure that each team member will be able to contribute to them, despite their technical backgrounds.

In the end I will suggest a way to measure test coverage not only for unit tests but also for feature/acceptance tests and why this is necessary. I will also show a possible tool chain to support that.
