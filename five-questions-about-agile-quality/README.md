1. What is (software) quality?
------------------------------
Well essentially software is a tool -- just like a hammer or a screw driver. It might be complex -- maybe more like a car or even a plane -- but it is still a tool.

So software quality should be pretty much the same as tool quality. If I think about a hammer I think the following quality features are most valuable to me:
- It does what it should -- in case of a hammer it should help me to get a nail into a wall. One could call this _usefulness_.
- It should not break -- when I hammer the nail the head of the hammer should stay fixed with the handle. This could be called _stability_.
- It does not confuse me -- a hammer needs a handle and a head, nothing more. I'd like to call that _useablitiy_.
- It is fast -- it should not take to long to get the nail into the wall. So I care about the tools _performance_.
- It should look good -- its look should go well with my other tools. This might not be as important than the other things but I think _beauty_ is a feature.
- And of course it should have a good test coverage... wait, what? I don't care about test coverage, I simply expect that all the other things were properly tested!

This list is not complete but I think it shows what we really should care about when we develope software. Test coverage is just a help for us to achive _real value_ like stability. It is not what the user really wants.

2. What is agile software developent?
-------------------------------------
When we use Scrum to develope software there is a Product Owener that will give user stories to the Team, that will develope the features described by the story and deliver it as shippable code. There is a Review in which the Product Owner (and maybe some Stakeholders) accepts of declines the delivered code.

3. Who is interested in quality?
--------------------------------
It is the Stakeholdes that really care about quality. The users want to use a good software that maks their work easier, the customers want their workers to be more efficiant etc. In Scrum there people are represented by the Product Owner so it is the Product Owner who should be interested for them.

Also the team has a certain interest to deliver quality work simply because producing good products feels better to them.

4. Who is responsible for quality?
----------------------------------
The Team is responsible to deliver _shipable code_. However shipable code that does not do what the user wanted it to do is not useful and therefore its quality is low. So the Product Owner has his/her share of responseability for quality by writing and prioritising the stakeholders' requirements and explaining them as User Stories to the Team.

5. How can we ensure quality in/by an agile process?
----------------------------------------------------
Well testing seams a good idea -- but what needs to be tested? In other words how do I test quality? By testing everything that quality is (see question 1).
